\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:intro}

The Group Design Practical is a course taken by all 2nd year undergraduate students at the University of Oxford studying for a degree in Computer Science, Mathematics and Computer Science, or Computer Science and Philosophy. This report details the work of Group 14 from February to May 2024 to design, implement, and deploy a product satisfying the specification as provided by Micro:Bit. \\

The project itself may be viewed on the page \url{https://ox24-cctd-ml-machine.pages.dev}, and the source code is publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/Ike-G/ox24-cctd-ml-machine}.

\subsection{Technical context}%
\label{subsec:context}

Our project is based on a machine learning tool developed by researchers at the Centre for Computational Thinking and Design at Aarhus University. This tool is publicly deployed at \url{https://ml-machine.org}, with its source code available at \url{https://github.com/microbit-foundation/cctd-ml-machine}. Our project is a fork of this repository, extending the existing project. \\

ML-Machine is an application for users with access to a physical micro:bit device to train a machine learning model that uses the micro:bit's sensors as input data. The user is given a 3 step process:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Named `Gestures' are added, for the trained model to eventually use as classification categories. The user then adds to each gesture several recordings of the accelerometer that correspond to the particular gesture. Alternatively, they can use the example dataset, containing the categories `shake' (with recordings of the micro:bit being shook), `still' (with recordings of the micro:bit not moving), and `circle' (with recordings of the micro:bit being moved in a circle).
  \item The user trains a model -- either a dense layers model, or a k-nearest neighbours model -- to classify the data. The recordings are pre-processed using a set of filters, which build the feature set. Before training, the user may select in particular which filters they would like to use.
        \item The micro:bit then has its sensors periodically polled in order to predict, of the labelled gestures, the one most similar to its current movement.
\end{enumerate}

The web application is written using the Svelte framework\footnote{\url{https://svelte.dev}}, acting essentially as an HTML template language. The micro:bit itself requires additional drivers to interface with the application, as first a bluetooth connection must be established, and then the appropriate sensor data must be streamed to the application. These are written in C++, and then converted into \verb|.hex| files, which users can install on their micro:bits in order to allow this procedure to work. Both models are trained in the browser using TensorFlow.js\footnote{\url{https://www.tensorflow.org/js}}. \\

\subsection{Project Specification}%
\label{subsec:spec}

In consideration of the existing context, the specifications set out by Micro:Bit were designed with a view to utilise our work for experimental purposes, and to provide a benchmark for evaluating the feasibility of future projects. On this basis, the specification gave the following requirements of a final product:
\begin{itemize}
  \item That a user should be able to train any model on not just the Micro:bit's accelerometer, but also an additional sensor.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item The user should be able to choose which sensor's data is to be streamed into the training data (and thus, which sensor's data is polled once the model is trained).
                \item Information given by the sensor should be visualised to the user in real-time in a manner which is understandable.
                \item The sensor data should be amenable to machine-learning analysis via the models available.
        \end{itemize}
  \item In addition to the Dense Neural Network, and the k-Nearest Neighbours models of the base application, a new neural network architecture should be investigated for implementation.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item This network should be capable of predicting on simple patterns with reasonable accuracy.
                \item The technical details of the network should be of pedagogical value, in addition to being amenable to high-level explanation.
                \item The trained model should be of a size that could fit on the micro:bit itself, rather than needing to run on a connected device\footnote{The Micro:Bit team have expressed a desire to run the prediction models directly on the micro:bit in future, rather than in the browser, allowing for the model to be stored independently of the application. This was not itself within the scope of our specification however.}.
                \item Model training should be responsive on standard browsers ran on computers with low-end modern hardware.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Logistics}%
\label{sec:logistics}

This section describes the timeline of our development, and how we went about structuring the delegation of work.

\subsection{Timeline}%
\label{subsec:timeline}

\begin{itemize}
        \item 24th January -- First briefing meeting, team members were introduced to one another, and communication channels were created.
        \item 26th January -- First internal meeting, we decided on our three preferred projects, one of which was the project we were ultimately assigned.
        \item 20th February -- First meeting with both supervisors. The project and existing code were explained, with directions given to relevant tools. It was decided that two weeks were to be given to all group members to analyse and understand the existing code, and decide on their areas of focus.
        \item 3rd March -- Project repository fork was created at \url{https://github.com/Ike-G/ox24-cctd-ml-machine}.
        \item 5th March -- Initial internal meeting to organise plans for initial development over the Hilary vacation. Plans were set to have weekly internal meetings, and weekly external meetings, on Mondays and Tuesdays respectively. An initial role distribution was decided.
        \item 9th March -- Beginning of Hilary vacation.
        \item 12th March --
